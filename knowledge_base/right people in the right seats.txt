Learn how to fix a struggling startup by putting the right people in the right seats. 

As a startup leader you are constantly looking for that one thing that can change everything for the better.  But since your time is limited, what should you focus on? 

That's a big question. 

I propose that you focus on how to get the right people into the right seats! 

First, consider moving team members around, if someone is better suited to be a leader then put them in the position to own the outcomes. 

Second, consider fresh A level talent.  Bring in the right people from the outside to put into those leadership seats, identify the best candidates you can afford.   

Third, don't wing the hiring process, apply an actual system that works to eliminate gut feelings and guessing. For example, there is a book called "Who" that describes one excellent method that includes a simple 4 step process to follow. Its focused around a scorecard that defines mission, outcomes and competencies for the candidate, I will include a link below.

With the three steps in place, think about the impact to your business and your life.  With better performers, would you be able to take time off and actually enjoy yourself? Would the revenue improve? Would you go to market faster?  

Remember, A players want to work with other A players.  So once you begin this approach you can't ever stop, always be recruiting and then simply measure and observe: 

Is your team getting more done? 
Are the new A players feeling good and recommending additional hires? 
What is the client feedback? 
Is the overall momentum growing? 

Give this approach a try, remember, if it doesn't work you can always go back.
