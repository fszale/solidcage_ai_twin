Learn how to improve your startup's engineering team's productivity with three simple steps to follow. 

As a startup leader, you are constantly looking to improve your team's productivity. Do you know how to do that? What are the actual steps to take? 

I propose the following three step approach. 

First, reduce the number of meetings.  Organize the work, front load meetings to Mondays/Tuesdays or short sessions each morning.  Engineers needs to focus on work first.  They will appreciate this change more than you can imagine. 

Second, identify the top 3 bottlenecks slowing down the team.  Think about a part of a process, deployment, testing, planning, anything that is time consuming and could be automated.  If possible, connect each improvement opportunity to revenue generation, risk mitigation or cost savings. This is about the impact your team delivers and not just how efficient they work, this is most important to the organization so make this a priority. 

Third, apply Pareto principle to breakdown the work needed for the improvements proposed.  In other words, focus on 20% of the work needed to deliver 80% of the value. This is about being efficient and quickly delivering most value with least amount of work.
