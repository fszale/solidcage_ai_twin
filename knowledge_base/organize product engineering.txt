I am going to share with you how to stop working crazy hours at your startup while building multiple products at the same time.  

Working on multiple products at the same time is quite a challenge.  Especially when you have a small team and tight deadlines, and this is such a typical experience when working at a startup or as part of a small team in a larger organization. 

Let me share with you how to think about prioritizing tasks to : 

• reduce risks 
• improve the probability of a successful outcome  
• and find ways to accelerate the deliverables 

The key to success is to : 

• identify overlapping capabilities or components across multiple products being developed 
• tackle these components first 
• but build only the minimum of what's needed to build an entire end to end solution 
• first iteration has to move fast to build the momentum 

I understand that the outcomes won't be perfect but building first iteration of an end state and gathering feedback from the users will set a strong foundation for subsequent iterations, all the while greatly reducing many of the risks. When done correctly, this will enable you and your team to begin to reduce overtime, lower stress levels and take baby steps towards some sort of work life balance.
