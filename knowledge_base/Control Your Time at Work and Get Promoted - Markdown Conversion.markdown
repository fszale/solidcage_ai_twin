**Problem**  
Young startups are notorious for lots of overtime, competing priorities, crazy deadlines, endless pivots, and effectively no work-life balance.  
Have you wondered how to get promoted at your startup without having to resort to working crazy hours all the time? Is it even possible to work regular hours in such an environment and still get promoted?  
Elon has an awesome work ethic; we all heard about his 100-hour work weeks during the "production hell". Do you think people got promoted in part because they worked long hours and were accessible to Elon at all times?  
There is a practical approach you can adopt to make an impact, get promoted, and not sacrifice your personal time, but it does require a mindset shift.

**Solution**  
Let me share with you a mindset to adopt that will:  
- Turn you into a superstar in the eyes of your team and leadership  
- Help you achieve work-life balance  
- Have a positive long-term impact across the organization  

The key to success is to:  
- Associate $1000 dollars cost for every hour of your time; how would this change the way you work and act?  
- Focus on opportunities to level up your team.  
- Apply Pareto principle, focus early on the 20% of the work that delivers 80% of the value.

**Outcomes**  
Your mindful approach and focused effort to enable the team to have larger impact will deliver tangible results. Your work will create tremendous value to the organization and will be noticed by the leadership.  
With intentional focus on maximizing value of regular working time and avoiding overtime (the brute force), your team will greatly appreciate the value of your approach. They will naturally embrace your strategy and attempt to replicate it across the organization as they migrate to other positions over time (ripple effect).  
This technique works equally well for leaders at all levels and individual contributors.

**Thought Exercise - What's Your Time Worth to You?**  
We all know that we have limited time, and cannot simply walk into a store and buy some more. Time is the only non-renewable resource. Let's agree that your time is incredibly precious. Consider assigning a high dollar figure for every hour of your time, for example $1000 per hour.  
$1000 dollars is what every hour of your day costs YOU.  
- How would this change the way you think and act at work?  
- Would you prioritize your actions at work differently?  
- Would you look for ways to multiply your effectiveness and impact of your hard work?  
Working overtime costs you time (and money, $1000/hr), therefore it makes logical sense to limit your expense and work just the regular hours. However, you still want to get promoted; therefore, you need to find a way to improve your impact during the hours you commit to work.

## Page 6: Level Up Your Team

**To Make an Impact, Level Up Your Team!**  
Team effectiveness often defaults to the lowest common denominator. To combat this, all team members need to level up in some way.  
Find ways to help the team learn and grow; it could be as simple as additional training, Udemy.com courses, internal resources, hosted whiteboarding sessions, POCs, hackathons, whatever it takes, own it!  
The benefits of training cannot be overstated.  
Effects of leveling up the team, during the course of a project, are similar to how your investments grow over time due to compound interest. Invest in people and the product will be of higher quality, just a bit easier to maintain, slightly more resilient, engineering iterations just a tad faster, you get the idea.  
In addition, the larger organization will also experience a positive ripple effect. Over time, people on your project will gain invaluable expertise. Eventually, they will migrate into other parts of the organization where they will be free to share their newly acquired wisdom.

**Idea Evaluator**  
- Take the ideas you are considering and evaluate carefully in accordance with the idea evaluator.  
- Consider impact to all the people involved, classify groups, upside/downside.  
- Consider impact to the process, can the process be improved, can the improvement be quantified.  
- Consider impact on the technology, will it become easier to maintain, will it cost less to operate.  
- Consider how these ideas connect to revenue generation, risk mitigation, and/or cost savings, is it possible to connect to all three.  
- Identify risks applicable to every consideration (people, process, technology, revenue generation, cost savings, risk mitigation).  
- Consider risk of inaction.  
- Identify 20% of the work related to these ideas that will deliver 80% of the value.  
- Break down the deliverables in terms of a 30/60/90 plan.  
- First principles is left out of consideration on purpose (subject to another video).
