Learn how to implement a 4-day workweek in a startup with three simple steps to follow. 

I am sure you heard about a 4 day workweek, most everyone seems to love this concept but how do you actually get there in your startup? What are the actual steps to take? 

I propose the following three step approach. 

First, eliminate all meetings on Fridays.  Move client meetings to other days to the best of your ability. Consider this day sacred. 

Second, consider frontloading each week with meetings to help team members use remaining days of the week to focus on the actual work. Alternatively, schedule meetings early in the day so that bulk of each day can be dedicated to actual work. 

Third, prioritize process automation, think Zapier integrations, devops practices, automated emails.  Align team members to embrace task automation, the idea is to improve every process even if just a little, eliminate any mundane and repetitive tasks that consume precious time.

With the three steps in place, think about how your business would function with a 4 day workweek.  Your customers need to be supported all week long, so simply have the team members alternate their 4 day workweek for overlapping coverage. 

Finally, pick an upcoming quarter and switch to a 4 day workweek, then simply measure and observe: 

Is your team getting more done? 
Is your team feeling happier, what do they think? 
How is client success, any feedback? how is client retention rate?
 
So give this approach a try, and remember, if it doesn't work you can always go back.
