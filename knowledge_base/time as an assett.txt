A few years back I was watching this movie "In Time" about how the rich people live forever but the poor died young and it made me really think about how I and many people live our lives. 

But something about this movie really struck me, it made me see our world that we live in in a way where I had little to no control over my time, stuck in a perpetual grind with a promise of a distant retirement and brief moment of rest and then certain death. 

Do you ever question why we have to work so hard? Why is this world designed this way? Does it have to be like this? I don't remember voting for this, do you? 
 
This has driven me to try to figure out this game of life, and as a result I created a spreadsheet based model to show you how to optimize for invaluable time. 

I want you to change your life, so that you can take advantage of the time you have and live better, work less and optimize for time and would love to hear your perspective on the value of time and how you are optimizing your life.
