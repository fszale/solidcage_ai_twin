Don't get fired from a startup, take charge with a 30/60/90 plan.

**Problem**  
You have joined a startup, congratulations! Now ask yourself what is important for you to focus on? You can wait for the exact direction to be provided for you, you can also choose to lead.  
Take charge of this opportunity and develop an effective 30/60/90 work plan. You will help your team members and impress higher-level leadership at the same time.  
How do you then build and execute the roadmap so that the outcomes move the needle without working everyone to death and drive people insane in the process! The plan should inspire feelings of confidence from the management team and be embraced by the entire engineering team.  
This plan must address concerns, minimize risks, and deliver tangible value.

**Solution**  
Let me share with you how to think about building the 30/60/90 plan to:  
- Reduce risks  
- Improve the value of the outcomes  
- And find ways to accelerate the deliverables  

The key to success is to:  
- Address concerns about the impact to people, process, and technology.  
- Apply Pareto principle, focus early on the 20% of the work that delivers 80% of the value.  
- Identify outcomes you can deliver that impact revenue generation, risk mitigation, and cost savings.

**Outcomes**  
Your 30/60/90 plan will make it transparent how your work delivers value. This clarity will in turn inspire feelings of confidence in higher-level management. Your engineering team will understand the value of their work and in the process reassure themselves that the mission they are on is worthy of their perseverance and commitment.  
But the most important outcome is that you and your team may be able to avoid overtime, lower stress levels, and begin your journey towards work-life balance.  
Rest assured, you become the hero you were always meant to be:  
This technique works equally well for leaders at all levels and individual contributors.

## Page 5: Idea Evaluator
**CONTROL THE OUTCOME**  
**Idea Evaluator**  
- Take the ideas you are considering and evaluate carefully in accordance with the idea evaluator.  
- Consider impact to all the people involved, classify groups, upside/downside.  
- Consider impact to the process, can the process be improved, can the improvement be quantified.  
- Consider impact on the technology, will it become easier to maintain, will it cost less to operate.  
- Consider how these ideas connect to revenue generation, risk mitigation, and/or cost savings, is it possible to connect to all three.  
- Identify risks applicable to every consideration (people, process, technology, revenue generation, cost savings, risk mitigation).  
- Consider risk of inaction.  
- Identify 20% of the work related to these ideas that will deliver 80% of the value.  
- Break down the deliverables in terms of a 30/60/90 plan.  
- First principles is left out of consideration on purpose (subject to another video).

## Page 7: Example
**CONTROL THE OUTCOME**  
**Example**  
Let's consider two distinct scenarios of an early-stage startup and technology department in a series B startup.  
- **Scenario A** - young startup, team in place, products, issues, and tech debt exist, new products needed, 15 people total.  
- **Scenario B** - technology department in a startup, product support, tech debt, complex organizational dependencies, new products needed, 90 people total.  
I will demonstrate how to identify opportunities to focus on, think through the use cases, minimize risks, and address concerns related to people, process, and technology.

**PARETO PRINCIPLE**  
**REVENUE GENERATION, RISK MITIGATION, COST SAVINGS**  
**Scenario A - Young Startup**  
- Engineering team in place  
- Some products exist  
- Some customer support  
- Some product issues  
- Technical debt growing  
- New products to be built  
- 15 people total  

- Ask everyone for low-hanging fruit opportunities, seek out product enhancements, process bottlenecks, common customer complaints, classify them in accordance with which of these categories (revenue generation/risk mitigation/cost savings) do they impact and to what degree.  
- Identify ideas with the most impact (preferably all three classifications are touched), consider how each idea impacts people, process, and technology in the organization, each area needs to have risks identified in addition to the benefits, rank the risks and benefits as you see fit.  
- Consider what components of each of the ideas can be delivered quickly to deliver the majority of the benefit, focus on the 20% of the work that delivers 80% of the value.  
- Map the activities related to the highest impact ideas in accordance with delivery schedule, 30/60/90 should be thought of as immediate/soon/later, consider existing product roadmap.

**Scenario B - Technology Department in a Startup**  
- Engineering team in place  
- Complex product line  
- Customer support exists  
- Product issues backlog  
- Permanent technical debt  
- Limited product development  
- 90 people total  

- Ask everyone for low-hanging fruit opportunities, review backlog, common customer complaints, identified tech debt, process bottlenecks, classify them in accordance with which of these categories (revenue generation/risk mitigation/cost savings) do they impact and to what degree.  
- Identify ideas with the most impact (preferably all three classifications are touched), consider how each idea impacts people, process, and technology in the organization, each area needs to have risks identified in addition to the benefits, rank the risks and benefits as you see fit.  
- Consider what components of each of the ideas can be delivered quickly to deliver the majority of the benefit, focus on the 20% of the work that delivers 80% of the value.  
- Map the activities related in accordance with the delivery schedule (probability of delivery to the end user) and degree of impact, 30/60/90 should be thought of as immediate/soon/later.

**How Does This Help Me?**  
This approach brings about a WIN-WIN-WIN situation for the engineering team, end users, and management.  
- Engineers can work without analysis paralysis and produce work that rapidly delivers meaningful impact.  
- End users get meaningful benefit from the delivered work in a short timeframe.  
- Management can quickly realize proposed ROI and observe beneficial impact of the work in the organization.
