I am going to help you get your engineering team unstuck with a shake the box approach. 

An engineering project can sometimes get stuck as the pace of innovation slows down to a crawl while people continue to work overtime due to "organizational pressure".  I have observed this at larger organizations on occasion.  Does not really matter whom or what to blame, bottom line is that the energy connected to the project has degraded, organizational paralysis takes hold and team members become increasingly frustrated as they struggle to see a way out.   

What if you could turn this situation around? 

Would you be willing to re-energize these team members, and in the process rescue the project? 

Let me share with you some useful ideas and explain the strategy to correct this situation. 

The key to success is to : 
• identify 3 goals for the team members that can be an easy win in a very short timeframe (two weeks or less if possible) 
• look for opportunities that relate to revenue growth, risk mitigation, or cost savings, preferably one of each  
• apply Pareto principle, focus on the 20% of needed activity that can deliver 80% of the value 
• achieve these goals to then move to define the new "moonshot" goal for the team, be ambitious 

Great future vision is an effective tool to refocus the team and provide a vital shot of optimism. Help the team to embrace a thought process where nothing is impossible. Let the “moonshot” be the ultimate software product that the team rallies around.
