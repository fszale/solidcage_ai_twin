I am going to show you how to take charge in your startup, develop a solid 30/60/90 work plan and keep your job and equity. 

You have joined a startup, congratulations! Now you have an opportunity to take charge and develop an effective 30/60/90 work plan.  The question is how to build the roadmap so that the outcomes move the needle without working everyone to death and driving people insane, or worse like getting fired! 

Let me share with you what to consider and how to think about all the various aspects necessary to build a work plan for yourself, one that the higher level management will support 100%.  

The key to success is to : 

• address people, process and technology concerns 
• apply Pareto principle, focus on the 20% that delivers 80% of the value 
• and identify workstreams focused on revenue generation, risk mitigation and cost savings 

You plan will inspire feelings of confidence from the management and reassures the engineering team that a correct approach has been taken.  You will rule the day and become the hero you were meant to be!
