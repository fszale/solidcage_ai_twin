I am going to show you how to work less at your startup but also get a lot more done. 

Congratulations! You are working at a startup, lots of action, wearing multiple hats, crazy hours, yet another pivot, things are happening, love it, I get it.  But, at some point you got to ask, how can I do more with less and NOT have to work all the time.   

I know Elon loves to grind hard, and many people are inspired by his work ethic, but I dare to ask, is it really necessary?   

What if there is another approach?  

A smart tactic that yields tangible results without burning everyone out. 

Let me share with you how to think and approach work, so that you can get more done while working normal hours. 

The key to success is to : 

• bias towards action, avoid analysis paralysis, just get started, write something down, get going 
• enable others 
• identify achievable daily TO DOs 
• apply Pareto principle, focus on the 20% that delivers 80% of the value 

Successful people have a strong bias towards action, think about these people for a second, they own it and go.   

Knowing where and how to focus your actions, being intentional will lead you to become consistently productive over time without having to fall back on the brute force approach, which is working overtime.
