**Problem**  
Working at a startup has lots of highs and lows; it's common to have lots of fires along the journey, long weekend hours, last-minute code changes, production mishaps, and all sorts of unidentified issues. In such intense work environments, few people are willing to work the on-call and be the go-to person for difficult problem-solving.  
Firefighting skill set is valuable, especially in organizations with complex products and high downtime costs. Performing diagnosis of an issue under pressure is stressful and demanding, therefore these positions are difficult to fill.  
Would you consider taking on such a position and in the process become a hero to your fellow team members?  
Let me share with you how you can get started and what strategy to apply to become a super effective firefighter.

**Solution**  
Let me share with you some tactics to:  
- Learn firefighting  
- Boost team morale  
- Become a hero  

The key to success is to:  
- Say yes to on-call; it’s sink or swim time, don’t have any fear. If you are new, you will be paired up with an experienced engineer.  
- Identify parts of the system prone to the highest rate of failure, then study the code and learn how to test all related components so that you have hands-on knowledge of how they should behave when NOT working.  
- Understand possible exceptions; that’s the key to rapid diagnosis under pressure.  
- After a crisis is resolved, step up and own the implementation of a permanent fix.

Being on point for high-pressure situations forces you into a rapid learning mode; your ability to comprehend various systems and tools will grow at an exponential rate. Soon you will be able to stop guessing what is happening and instead actually know what’s happening, and of course, every problem solved becomes a story to talk about during your review as you negotiate your pay rise.  
Your willingness to face issues head-on will enable the rest of the team to focus on their work. The team morale will rapidly improve as a result, and you will quickly become the hero you were always meant to be.  
Your leadership will also be welcomed by higher-level management.

First step to becoming a firefighter is to say YES to on-call and deployments. Don’t fear this; the rest of the organization will not let you fail. If you are new, someone senior will be in charge and will provide guidance.  
Focus on attention to detail; make sure to read any existing documentation regarding issue identification and resolution. This is especially true in larger technical organizations with lots of existing systems in place. Often, operational playbooks and issue resolution documentation are out of date and will need updates; that’s great, own this and make the changes after handling an issue. In an early startup, you may be forced to be the one writing this documentation, which is also an excellent experience.  
Please document everything: how the issue occurred, who had to do what, when the issue occurred, where, and why it happened. This will be the basis for developing skills around rapid issue diagnosis and resolution.

**System Analysis**  
Becoming effective at firefighting requires a proper understanding of the systems you are responsible for. You should develop a comfortable understanding of the architecture, all the relevant system inputs, outputs, internal processing components, user capabilities, and end-to-end testing procedures.  
Focus on the parts of the system prone to the highest rate of failure. If possible, study the source code, unit, and integration tests, and learn how to test all related system components so that you develop hands-on knowledge of how they should behave when NOT working, in addition to normal operating behavior.  
Understanding possible exceptions, how to identify and resolve them, is the key to rapid issue diagnosis under pressure when the system is down.  
Validate your understanding by executing hands-on testing in lower environments (dev/staging); also, connect with the original engineers to review your newly developed body of knowledge. Ask questions to validate your knowledge: the who, what, when, where, why, and how in the context of the system.

**Own the Fix!**  
As soon as the crisis has passed, step up and own the implementation of a permanent fix. If applicable, think long-term solutions that will permanently resolve the issue. Plan the work to implement source code fixes, deploy proactive monitoring, enable self-healing, testing, update technical documentation, operational playbooks, and train fellow team members.  
Consider how the permanent fix impacts people, processes, and technology in the organization; each area has different risks. Rank the risks and benefits as you see fit before deciding next steps. Analyze components of a proposed fix to identify those parts that can be delivered quickly to provide the majority of the benefit; focus on the 20% of the work that delivers 80% of the value (Pareto principle).  
Ownership mentality is one of the most sought-after character traits and is desperately needed in all organizations. Own the fix; if possible, apply corrections yourself to enable the rest of the team to focus on their work.
